The provided Java file contains a basic program for generating an invoice based on a list of products. Here's a summary of the code:

Main Class (InvoiceGenerator):

Creates a list of products.
Adds several products to the list with specific names, prices, and quantities.
Creates an invoice with the list of products.
Generates and prints the invoice.
Product Class:

Represents a product with a name, price, and quantity.
Includes getters for these attributes.
Invoice Class:

Holds a list of products.
Generates an invoice string that lists each product's name, quantity, and total price (price * quantity).
Calculates the total cost of all products.
Here is the complete code for reference:

java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class InvoiceGenerator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of products
        List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
        products.add(new Product("Product 1", 20.0, 2));
        products.add(new Product("Product 2", 15.0, 3));
        products.add(new Product("Product 3", 10.0, 1));

        // Create an invoice
        Invoice invoice = new Invoice(products);

        // Generate the invoice
        String generatedInvoice = invoice.generateInvoice();

        // Print the invoice
        System.out.println(generatedInvoice);
    }
}

class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int quantity;

    public Product(String name, double price, int quantity) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }
}

class Invoice {
    private List<Product> products;

    public Invoice(List<Product> products) {
        this.products = products;
    }

    public String generateInvoice() {
        StringBuilder invoice = new StringBuilder();
        invoice.append("Invoice\n");
        invoice.append("---------\n");

        for (Product product : products) {
            invoice.append(product.getName()).append(" x ").append(product.getQuantity()).append(" = ").append(product.getPrice() * product.getQuantity()).append("\n");
        }

        invoice.append("Total: ").append(calculateTotal());

        return invoice.toString();
    }

    private double calculateTotal() {
        return products.stream().mapToDouble(product -> product.getPrice() * product.getQuantity()).sum();
    }
}

Here's a README file for the Java program:

Invoice Generator
Overview
The Invoice Generator is a simple Java program designed to generate and print an invoice based on a list of products. Each product has a name, price, and quantity. The invoice includes the details of each product and the total cost.

Features
Add products with specific names, prices, and quantities.
Generate an invoice listing each product's name, quantity, and total price.
Calculate and display the total cost of all products.
Program Structure
The program consists of three main classes:

InvoiceGenerator
Product
Invoice
InvoiceGenerator
This is the main class that initializes the program. It creates a list of products, adds several products to the list, creates an invoice with these products, generates the invoice, and prints it.

java
Copy code
public class InvoiceGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of products
        List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
        products.add(new Product("Product 1", 20.0, 2));
        products.add(new Product("Product 2", 15.0, 3));
        products.add(new Product("Product 3", 10.0, 1));

        // Create an invoice
        Invoice invoice = new Invoice(products);

        // Generate the invoice
        String generatedInvoice = invoice.generateInvoice();

        // Print the invoice
        System.out.println(generatedInvoice);
    }
}
Product
This class represents a product with a name, price, and quantity. It includes getters for these attributes.

java
Copy code
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int quantity;

    public Product(String name, double price, int quantity) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }
}
Invoice
This class is responsible for holding the list of products, generating the invoice string, and calculating the total cost.

java
Copy code
public class Invoice {
    private List<Product> products;

    public Invoice(List<Product> products) {
        this.products = products;
    }

    public String generateInvoice() {
        StringBuilder invoice = new StringBuilder();
        invoice.append("Invoice\n");
        invoice.append("---------\n");

        for (Product product : products) {
            invoice.append(product.getName()).append(" x ").append(product.getQuantity()).append(" = ").append(product.getPrice() * product.getQuantity()).append("\n");
        }

        invoice.append("Total: ").append(calculateTotal());

        return invoice.toString();
    }

    private double calculateTotal() {
        return products.stream().mapToDouble(product -> product.getPrice() * product.getQuantity()).sum();
    }
}
How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
Save the code in a file named InvoiceGenerator.java.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
